## TTS Tensorflow description with the different  models

This is based on the TTS Tensorspeech project: 
* Github: https://github.com/TensorSpeech/TensorflowTTS
* Audio samples:  https://tensorspeech.github.io/TensorflowTTS/

TensorFlowTTS provides real-time state-of-the-art speech synthesis architectures such as Tacotron-2, Melgan, Multiband-Melgan, FastSpeech, FastSpeech2 based-on TensorFlow 2.
With Tensorflow 2, we can speed-up training/inference progress, optimizer further by using fake-quantize aware and pruning,
make TTS models can be run faster than real-time and be able to deploy on mobile devices or embedded systems.
